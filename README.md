# Python_beginner
This repository is the coding that I learned on [Dr. Ryan Wesslen's](https://wesslen.netlify.app/) DSBA-6188 Text Mining and Information Retrieval. The coding was used for Python beginners like me to learn the basic skills of starting and using Python. Including Jupyter, visual environments, zsh, ngrok, etc.
